# bret's corner

Bret’s Corner is my little digital playground — a cozy spot on the web where I stash the cool things I’ve been working on. It’s not meant to be overly formal or polished — just a collection of side quests, late-night coding sprints, and ideas I couldn’t shake.

Some projects are done, some are forever “in progress,” and others are just experiments I had fun with. Whether it's a quick app, a weird concept, or something I'm surprisingly proud of — it's all here, under one roof.

This isn’t just a portfolio — it’s a corner of the internet that feels like me. Welcome, and feel free to poke around.



## 🚀 About Me
Hey, I’m Bret — a curious mind, builder of things, and someone who finds joy in solving problems through code (and occasionally breaking things to learn how they work).

I’m currently a Computer Systems Engineering student, and this space — Bret’s Corner — is where I share projects that excite me, ideas I’m experimenting with, and stuff I’ve made just for fun. I love creating tools, apps, and little digital artifacts that reflect both what I know and what I’m learning.
